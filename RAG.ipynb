      "Using Azure OpenAI for Copilot development involves leveraging the AI models such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to assist in writing and optimizing code, providing documentation, or other programming related activities. Here are some steps to guide you through setting up and using Azure OpenAI for Copilot-like functionalities:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Setup an Azure Account and Subscribe to Azure OpenAI Service\n",
      "1. **Create an Azure Account**\n",
      "   - If you don't already have one, you need to first create an account on [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Subscribe to Azure OpenAI Service**\n",
      "   - Once logged in, you can find the Azure OpenAI service through the Marketplace or directly from the [Create a Resource] button. Follow the prompts to create a subscription.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Create an Azure OpenAI Resource\n",
      "1. **Navigate to your subscription and create a new resource** \n",
      "   - Choose the appropriate region, pricing tier, and review the terms.\n",
      "   - Create the resource and wait for it to be deployed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Obtain API Keys\n",
      "1. **After deployment, navigate to your resource's keys and endpoint** \n",
      "   - Securely store the API key and endpoint URL as you will need them to authenticate API requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Setup Your Development Environment\n",
      "1. **Choose Your Development Tools**\n",
      "   - You can use any preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Visual Studio Code, which has excellent support for Python and other programming languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Install Necessary SDKs and Tools**\n",
      "   - For example, if you're using Python, install the Azure SDK and any other relevant packages.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   pip install azure-ai-textanalytics azure-core\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **API Client Setup**\n",
      "   - Set up a client to interact with the OpenAI API using the keys and endpoint retrieved earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Integrate With Your Coding Environment\n",
      "1. **Create AI Assistant Functions**\n",
      "   - Write functions that will interact with OpenAI's API to generate code, suggestions, explanations, etc. Functions can include requesting code completions, generating explanations for code blocks, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient\n",
      "   from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential\n",
      "\n",
      "   key = \"<your-key>\"\n",
      "   endpoint = \"<your-endpoint>\"\n",
      "\n",
      "   text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint=endpoint, credential=AzureKeyCredential(key))\n",
      "\n",
      "   def generate_code(prompt):\n",
      "       response = text_analytics_client.generate(\n",
      "           { \"prompt\": prompt, \"max_tokens\": 150 }\n",
      "       )\n",
      "       return response.as_dict()\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use the Functions in Your IDE**\n",
      "   - Integrate these capabilities into your development workflow. For instance, in VS Code, you can use these functions within your coding sessions or trigger them via command palette extensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Test and Iterate\n",
      "1. **Continuous Testing**\n",
      "   - Constantly test the AI functionalities with different types of coding queries and prompts to ensure the model is returning useful responses.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Iterate Based on Feedback**\n",
      "   - Improve and adjust your functions based on feedback and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7: Consider Data Privacy and Security\n",
      "- Ensure your use of Azure OpenAI adheres to your organization's data security and privacy standards. Avoid sending sensitive data in API requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 8: Additional Integrations\n",
      "- Consider integrating other Azure services or third-party tools to enhance the functionality of your Copilot-like solution, such as GitHub Codespaces, AI debugger, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "This basic guide should get you started on using Azure OpenAI for Copilot development. Remember that the specifics might vary based on the programming language, IDE, and the details of what you're trying to achieve with your AI copilot.\n"
